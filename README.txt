# :rocket: Applied Data Science Capstone
This Capstone is the 10th (final) course in [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization, and it actually summarizes in the form of project all materials that have been learned during this specialization.
## :page_facing_up: Project Background
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. 
It is the only private company capable of returning a spacecraft from 
low-Earth orbit, and in 2012 its Dragon spacecraft became the first commercial 
spacecraft to deliver cargo to and from the International Space Station. 
And in 2020, SpaceX became the first private company to take humans there as well. 

SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; 
other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is 
because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore, if I can determine if the first stage 
will land, I can determine the cost of a launch. Spaces Xâ€™s Falcon 9 launch like regular rockets. 

My objective is to determine the price of each launch. Also, I will predict if SpaceX will reuse 
the first stage by training a machine learning model.

## :page_facing_up: Questions to be answered 
- How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of 
flights, and orbits affect the success of the first stage landing? 
- Does the rate of successful landings increase over the years? 
- What is the best algorithm that can be used for binary classification 
in this case?
## :page_facing_up: Methodology
  ### 1. Data collection methodology
  - SpaceX Rest API
  - Web scraping related Wiki pages
  ### 2. Data wrangling
  - Filtering the data
  - Dealing with missing values
  - Using One Hot Encoding to prepare the data to a binary classification
  ### 3. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL
  ### 4. Exploratory analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib
  ### 5. Interactive visual analytics and Dashboard using Folium and Plotly Dash
  ### 6. Predictive analysis using classification models
  - Building, fitting, and evaluation of classification models to ensure the best
  results
